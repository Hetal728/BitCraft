This will be an open source Minecraft server. By open source, the code is already open source for the most part, but by open-source, we mean that the server files are modifiable by anyone with consent from both the community AND me (Or just me). To add/modify a file, please fork the repository, modify/add whatever you want to add, commit, push, then pull request to the head repository. <b>THIS IS A MINECRAFT COMMUNITY, NO TROLLS/MALICIOUS CODE.</b>
